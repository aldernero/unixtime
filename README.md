# Unix Timestamp Converter

This is a simple Unix timestamp converter that I created as a "Hello World" type project to get familiar with
[HTMX](https://htmx.org/) + [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

I frequently need to do these conversions, and in the past I have used

- [Unix Timestamp - Epoch Converter (Dan's Tools)](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/)
- [Epoch Converter - Unix Timestamp Converter](https://www.epochconverter.com/)

Those sites are great, but now I run this in my homelab, and it makes life a bit easier.
